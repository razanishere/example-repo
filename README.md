this is an example repo

HELLO!

# untracked means a file that Git is not tracking nor updating. Thats why when a file is untracked we cant view it in our git repo.

# to wrap the new files to send it to github we do: git add (filename) >> now this file is called "Staged"

 now we need to commit the new file, we write: git commit -m "Initial commit"
